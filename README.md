Autodesk-Intern-Presentation
============================

This will be the presentation I gave to cap off my Internship at Autodesk. Since the work I did with the Conceptual Design team was recently released in this [Press Release](http://news.autodesk.com/press-release/architecture-engineering-construction-civil-infrastructure-and-natural-resources/aut-1), the material of this presentation is now public knowledge. 

This is the code (using reveal.js) for the presentation I gave. You can find the presentation [here](http://zfrenchee.github.io/Autodesk-Intern-Presentation)
